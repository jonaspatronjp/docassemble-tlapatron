#Assignment 2 - Docassemble Basics

#Using the "objects" initial block, modify your interview to use an “Individual” object to represent the user, and a DAList to rerpesent a list of other Individuals with whom the user lives.

#Using the “generic object modifier”, create a single question block in your interview file that asks for names of people.

#Add screens to your interview that request information with different interfaces:

#A Yes/No question using the “yesno” modifier

#A multiple-choice field that allows the user to select more than one option.

#A multiple-choice field that allows the user to select only one option.
